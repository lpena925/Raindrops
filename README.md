Raindrops
=========

A fun game where you can catch multicolored raindrops with a cute amazonian frog:) However, let too many spill on the ground and you lose.

NOTE: Depending on the display size of your screen, you may or may not experience some lag. Because the velocities are set to random values for the raindrops, some will be moving slower than the others. The score and level texts are supposed to change with the time and color of the newly added raindrop.

BUGS: Sometimes when you press a key to restart the game, the colors of the score and level texts will go crazy until the score reaches 10. The score sometimes also resets to 1 instead of 0. I haven't found out how to stop people from simply swiping their mouse across the screen to catch everything yet (I want some people to lose lol).
