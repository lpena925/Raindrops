Raindrops
=========

A fun game where you can catch multicolored raindrops in a cute bucket:)However, if let too many spill on the ground, you lose.

NOTE: Depending on the display size of your screen, you may or may not experience some lag. Because the velocities are set to random values for the raindrops, some will be moving slower than the others. The score and level texts are supposed to change with the time and color of the newly added raindrop.
